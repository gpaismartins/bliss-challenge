THIS IS A EXERCISE, WHICH IS PART OF A RECRUITING PROCESS

### node.js
You will need [node.js](https://nodejs.org)

### Install NPM packages and run build
Once you have node.js installed, open up your OS's Terminal/Bash application, change into the root folder of the test (where the file `package.json` is located) and run `npm install` ou `npm i`.

After all NPM packages installed successfully, the build process to compile is `npm run watch` or `npm run prod`

* `npm run watch` - starts the linters in watch mode; meaning on every file change the linters will run and give you instant feedback if there's something to improve

* `npm run prod` - will compile the css and js file to minified


Once complete have to running on server apache (ex: http://localhost/ )
